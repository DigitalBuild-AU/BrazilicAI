# Contributing to BrazilicAI

## Introduction
This document provides guidelines for anyone who wishes to contribute to the BrazilicAI project. By creating a welcoming and respectful community, we aim to make the contribution process easy and enjoyable for everyone.

## How to Submit Contributions

### Fork the Repo
Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account. This creates your own copy of the project, allowing you to work freely without affecting the original codebase.

### Create a Feature Branch
In your forked repository, create a new branch for your feature or bugfix. Naming your branch something descriptive like `feature/add-new-timesheet-format` or `bugfix/timesheet-upload-error` can be helpful.

### Commit Changes
Make your changes in your feature branch. Commit your changes with meaningful messages that explain what you've done and why. For example, `feat: add CSV export option for timesheets`.

### Submit a Pull Request
Once your changes are complete, submit a pull request (PR) to the main repository. In your PR, provide a detailed description of the changes and any other relevant information.

## Code of Conduct
We are committed to providing a welcoming and respectful environment for everyone. We expect all contributors to:
- Show respect and courtesy to other community members.
- Provide constructive feedback.
- Create a positive and inclusive environment.

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated. If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project maintainers.

## Coding Standards and Requirements
Contributors are expected to:
- Write tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Follow the coding conventions established in the project, such as naming conventions and code formatting.
- Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

By following these guidelines, you help us maintain a high standard of quality for the BrazilicAI project and make the contribution process smooth and enjoyable for everyone. Thank you for your interest in contributing!
